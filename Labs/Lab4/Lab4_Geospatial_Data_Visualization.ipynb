    "In this lab, you will analyze the geographical distribution of the population of the State of Illinois and its temporal changes from 1980 to 2010. You will find that most of the tasks were covered in the lecture, and it is another reproduction of the tasks. The difference is the study area (Illinois instead of Texas), and we focus on temporal changes of the general population instead of COVID-19 cases. \n",
