    "# Lab 3: Spatial data manipulation: Raster\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will analyze the impact of hurricane Harvey, which was happened in August 2017 in Texas. You will find that most of the tasks were covered in the lecture, and it is a reproduction of the tasks. The differences are the study area (Houston instead of Champaign), the index (<a href=https://eos.com/make-an-analysis/ndwi/>NDWI [Normalized Difference Water Index]</a> instead of NDVI [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index]), and the data source (Sentinel 2 instead of Landsat 8). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "### 1. Import Data (1 point)\n",
    "**1.1.** (0.5 point) Import and stack four bands collected on **August 15 2017**. Save the result as a format of `ndarray` and name it as `before_harvey`. <br>\n",
    "**1.2.** (0.5 point) Import and stack four bands collected on **September 1 2017**. Save the result as a format of `ndarray` and name it as `after_harvey`.\n",
    "### 2. Display (True / False) Color Images after Harvey (1 point)\n",
    "**2.1.** (0.5 point) Plot a true color image (R,G,B) after Harvey with `ep.plot_rgb()` method. <br>\n",
    "**2.2.** (0.5 point) Plot a false color image (NIR,R,G) after Harvey with `ep.plot_rgb()` method. <br>\n",
    "### 3. Calculate Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) \"Before\" and \"After\" Harvey (1 point)\n",
    "**3.1.** (0.5 point) Calculate NDWI **before** harvey and save it as `ndwi_before`. <br>\n",
    "**3.2.** (0.5 point) Calculate NDWI **after** harvey and save it as `ndwi_after`. <br>\n",
    "### 4. Classify Raster Image based on the NDWI (1 point)\n",
    "**4.1.** (0.5 point) Classify the values in `ndwi_before` array with `np.digitize()` method, and save the result as `ndwi_before_class`. <br>\n",
    "**4.2.** (0.5 point) Classify the values in `ndwi_after` array with `np.digitize()` method, and save the result as `ndwi_after_class`. <br>\n",
    "### 5. Calculate the area covered by water and its percentage over the entire area (1 point + a)\n",
    "**5.1.** (0.5 point) Calculate the percentage of area covered by water, **before** Hurricane Harvey, save it as `percent_before_harvey`. <br>\n",
    "**5.2.** (0.5 point) Calculate the percentage of area covered by water, **after** Hurricane Harvey,  save it as `percent_after_harvey`. <br>\n",
    "**5.3. (Extra 1 point)** Calculate the size of area (in Square KM) which wasn't covered by water before Harvey but covered by water after Harvey. Save the result as `diff_area` with the numerical format.\n",
