GEOG 489 (Programming for GIS) is the course of 4 undergraduate hours and 4 graduate hours and introduces Python programming skillsets to customize and extend the capabilities of Geographic Information Science (GIScience). As the importance of programming is highlighted throughout the discipline of geography, not limited to GIScience, the job market and community is actively looking for candidates who can handle data effectively and efficiently. To meet the needs, the topics of this class include programming principles, advanced function and tools coding, visualization, fundamental spatial data structures, and spatial algorithms, but are not limited to. The course is primarily a combination of lecture and hands-on programming workshops so that students will be taught how to customize existing spatial analysis tools to meet their needs with well-known Python packages, such as GeoPandas, Pysal, GDAL, etc. Students are also expected to run projects as a team to experience how to organize Python code with the geospatial libraries for their needs and taste.
